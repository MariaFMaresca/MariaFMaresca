# üí´ About Me:
Hello everyone! My name is Maria ![hand](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18350557/176309783-0785949b-9127-417c-8b55-ab5a4333674e.gif)
===========================================================================================================================

I am from South East London. After 15 years in customer service as a receptionist at LAX Gym, Ballymore Luxury Residential Apartments, and Hilton Hotels, I‚Äôve developed strong attention to detail, problem-solving skills, and the ability to work in fast-paced environments. <br><br>In the past, I achieved an Advanced Level 3 Certificate in Microsoft 365, where I became proficient in tools like PowerPoint, Excel, Word, and Access. These skills provided me with a solid foundation for working with data and started my passion for data analytics. This inspired me to enroll in the Data Technician Bootcamp program with Just IT, where I‚Äôve been focused into data collection, cleaning, analysis, and visualization.<br>I‚Äôve had the chance to work hands-on with Python, SQL, Excel, Power BI, and Tableau, tools that have made this journey both challenging and incredibly rewarding. I‚Äôm really enjoying learning how to transform data into insights that create meaningful impact. <br><br>My goal is to find a Junior Data Analyst or Data Technician role where I can apply my technical skills while continuing to learn from experienced professionals. I‚Äôm excited to help solve problems and provide insights that can make a real difference to the organization I work with.<br><br>Additionally, I have a passion for traveling, as it gives me the opportunity to learn about new cultures and enjoy diverse foods from around the world. I also value spending quality time with my family and staying active by going to the gym.<br>
